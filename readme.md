    To print addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo of two user entered numbers. 

5. **Logical and Bitwise Operators**: <br>
    To demonstrate working of logical and bitwise operators. 

6. **Decision-Making Statements**: <br>
    To implement programs using if, if.. else and Nested if.. else statements. 

7. **Conditional Statements**: <br>
    To implement a simple one-time calculator using switch case that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user choice. 

8. **Looping Statements**: <br>
    a) To calculate the sum of first n natural number using for loop. <br>
    b) To find the sum and product of all the digits of a user entered number using the while loop. <br>
    c) To reverse the digits of a user entered number using do...while loop. 

9. **Nested Loops**: <br>
    a) To print a series of repeated rows using nested for loop. <br>
    b) To print a series of repeated rows using nested while loop. 

10. **Flow Control Statements**: <br>
    a) To check working of break statement while printing numbers from 1 to 10. <br>
    b) To check working of continue statement while printing numbers from 1 to 10. 

11. **Patterns using Loops**: <br>
    To print diamond pattern using nested for loops. 

12. **Sum of Series using Loops**: <br>
    To calculate the value of series x=1+1/2!+1/3!+...+1/n! by using for loop.

13. **Functions**: <br>
    To find if a user entered number is prime or not using function. 

14. **Recursion**: <br>
    To calculate fibonacci series using recursive function.

15. **Array - Bubble Sort**: <br>
    To sort an array in ascending order using bubble sort method.

16. **Multi Dimensional Array**: <br>
    To display matrix multiplication by using multi- dimensional array.

17. **String - Palindrome**: <br>
    To check whether a given string is a palindrome or not. 

18. **Structures (structs)**: <br>
    To create array of structure to store the details of students as follows: roll number, name, marks of three subject (physics, chemistry and maths), calculate the total of marks and sort student data as per total in ascending order.

19. **Pointers**: <br>
    To swap two numbers using pointers.
